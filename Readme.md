# Collection of Python scripts

This is just a little collection of scripts I wrote. This is either historically or some of my practices.

* pyrecorder: A little practice script die save livestreams from inerent radios.
* zabbixctrl: Script to create / manage items/triggers/graph in the Zabbix monitoring system
